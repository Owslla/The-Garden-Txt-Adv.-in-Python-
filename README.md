# The-Garden-Txt-Adv.-in-Python-
The garden is a text-based adventure written in Python.  (project-based learning)

For me the easiest way to learn is by doing hands-on work. When I was a child I used basic on a Commodore 64 to create text adventures for myself and friends to go through. I felt it would be fun to go back to my roots and use a similar approach to teach myself Python. This is by no means a complete work it is a work in progress. It will likely never be finished. :)
