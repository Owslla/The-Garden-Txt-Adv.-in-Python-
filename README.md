# The Garden - A Text-Adventure written in Python

The garden is a text-based adventure written in Python 3+

(A project-based learning activity)

For me, the easiest way to learn is by doing hands-on work. When I was a child, I used Basic on a Commodore 64 to create text adventures for myself and friends to go through. I felt it would be fun to go back to my roots and use a similar approach to teach myself Python. This is by no means a complete work, though currently you can "complete" the game if you play. It will likely never be finished. :)

This particular work was originally inspired by going through the online course, “Learning Python the Hard Way” (http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ ). In particular, Exercise 36. You can find more information in the comment section at the top of each file.

The Garden-Map.png is not needed to play the game, it is just part of my planning process.  It can act as a guide of sorts, if you get stuck. ;)

# To Play

 - You will need Python 3 installed on the system.
 - Clone the repo, or place all the files in the same folder.  
 - Execute the following command in a terminal while in the same folder you just made in the previous step

```
python3 Garden.py
```
