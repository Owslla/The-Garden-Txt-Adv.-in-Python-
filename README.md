# The Garden: A text adventure written in Python

The Garden is a text-based adventure written in Python 3+.

(A Project-Based Learning Activity)

For me, the easiest way to learn is by doing hands-on work. When I was a child, I used Basic on a Commodore 64 to create text adventures for myself and friends to go through. I felt it would be fun to go back to my roots and use a similar approach to teach myself Python. This is by no means a complete work, though currently you can “complete” the game if you play. It will likely never be finished.

This particular work was originally inspired by going through the online course by Zed Shaw, “Learning Python the Hard Way” (http://learnpythonthehardway.org/). In particular, Exercise 36. You can find more information in the comment section at the top of each file.

## How To Play

To start playing the game, follow these easy steps:

1. **Get Python 3:** Make sure you have Python 3 on your computer. To check if you already have Python 3, open a terminal or command prompt and type:
```
python3 --version
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will show you the version of Python you have. If you don't see a version number, you need to install Python 3.

2. **Get the Game Files:** Download or clone the repository files and place them all in the same folder. The Garden-Map.png is not needed to play the game; it is just part of my planning process. It can act as a guide of sorts if you get stuck.
3. **Start the Game:** Open a terminal or command prompt and go to the folder where you put the game files. Then, type this:

```
python3 Garden.py
```
